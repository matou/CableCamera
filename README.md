# CableCamera

Code and additional files for an open source cable camera robot. 

I want to build a cable camera similar to systems like Skycam or Spidercam that are commonly used at large sports events. 

I made a [video about this on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAY1EcKFUaI). 

So far, there really isn't much here. You can find everything that I did for the video in this repository. My plan is to extend this significantly over time. So keep an eye on this repository if you'd like to know how it develops.
